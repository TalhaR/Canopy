# Project Starter
A starter repo for building CUNY Tech Prep projects with React, Express.js, and Sequelize.js

## Stack

*API*

- express.js
- sequelize.js

*React client*

- Built using `create-react-app` and configured to work with the api.
- Bootstrap 4.x added to `/client/public/index.html`
- React Router

### Running the app

For local development you will need two terminals open, one for the api-backend and another for the react-client.

*Clone* this app, then:

```bash
# api-backend terminal 1
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev
```

```bash
# react-client terminal 2
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

- api-backend will launch at: http://localhost:8080
- react-client will launch at: http://localhost:3000
